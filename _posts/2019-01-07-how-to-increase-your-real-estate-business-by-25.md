How can you increase your real estate business by 25% or more within a year? By reaching out to your sphere of influence (SOI).&nbsp;

First of all, your SOI is made up of friends, family, neighbors, coworkers, acquaintances, and past clients—**basically anyone you’ve had a relationship with at one point or another.**

How often should you reach out to these people? I believe you can find something to send at least every 30 days, though every two weeks would be ideal. Holidays are a good starting point, but you can find out much more about what they’re interested in through social media.&nbsp;

If you haven’t already added your SOI members to sites like Facebook, you should definitely do so. **Pay attention to what they’re posting about**—reach out to people who are having a tough time and let them know you’re thinking of them.

Our team has nine client events scheduled in the coming year, and these events alone give us a reason to contact clients almost every month. Come up with a reason to contact your clients often.

The average person knows seven people who will buy, sell, or invest in real estate within a year, which is why it’s so important to be in contact. **Every person you aren’t reaching out to could know someone who’s ready to jump into the market.**&nbsp;

My favorite clients are fun and easy to work with. A person tends to align themselves to similar people, so reach out to exceptional clients and ask if they know anyone with real estate needs.

In the end, **it’s much easier to do business with people who know, like, and trust you** than it is with internet leads, For Sale by Owners, door knocking, and even open houses. Take the step now to start building relationships in your SOI.

**I’d be happy to meet with you so we can see how to increase your business in 2019.** If you have any other questions, need more information, or would like to meet, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
