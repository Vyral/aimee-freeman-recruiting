As those of you who follow my social media accounts know by now, I’ve been posting a lot about the closing table event I attended between nine months and a year ago. **When I saw the level of experience people who were attending had, I told myself that I wanted to be a part of it at some point, too. **

After thinking about where my business started just five years ago and how fast it’s grown since then, I finally decided to jump off the ledge and go to the event.

When I finally went, my mind was blown. **This wasn’t another event to learn how to do more open houses or to talk about doing more business—this was far above that.**

Going to the closing table event didn’t really give me a ton of information to take home about building my real estate business, but it did open my eyes to all the other possibilities that are laid out before me.

On the first day, an agent got up and spoke, telling us how he makes $1 million per month. Can you even wrap your brain around what $1 million a month would even look like?

The attendees were all people who started with just an idea or a passion, which made me reflect on my own real estate business. I learned from them that there are so many things that we can do to take our business to the next level. 

Honestly, I’m still just trying to process all of what I took in. I don’t know what road I’ll go down next, but I do feel as though, one year from today, my business is going to look completely different from how it does now.

Many people think that they can just get their real estate license and build a business without ever doing any additional training, coaching, mentorship, or education. And maybe a big vision isn’t what some people want for their business.

**I’ve been licensed for 21 years myself, and last year, I traveled for 41 days to gain additional knowledge.** Could I never go to another conference again and still have enough knowledge to help build our team? Absolutely, but being around those who think bigger than you—who are building their business faster, better, and stronger than you—can be a great resource and motivation to surge forward in your career.

If you have a team or a business and you’re not going out to seek higher education for yourself and to bring back to your team, I encourage you to start. Sign up for some event in the next year, be it a small, local event or a conference across the country. It’s healthy to pick up perspectives from new people, places, and markets.

It might feel intimidating to put yourself in a room with all that talent, but you actually want to be the dumbest person in the room. It’s hard to identify how, but I know that going changed my life.

**If you decide to go to a continuing education event or would like suggestions about great events to attend, reach out to me.** I can help hold you accountable to your goal and/or direct you to an event that will push you out of your comfort zone in the best of ways.
