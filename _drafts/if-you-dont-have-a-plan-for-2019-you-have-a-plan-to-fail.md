Is it too soon to start planning your 2019 goals?

Absolutely not. You want to do your planning session in October or November at the latest. This is because, in real estate, the activities we do today are what pay us 30, 60, or 90 days from now. If you wait until January 1 to start planning for the new year, you won’t see effects until February or even March. There goes your first quarter!

What kind of plans can you make specifically for 2019? You can plan for your business goals, financial goals, health goals, spiritual goals, family goals, etc. When our team does our annual planning session, each person writes down at least three goals for each of these categories, and we set specific deadlines for them too.

For example, one of your business goals could be to increase your production by 50%. Obviously, the deadline for that would be December 31. If you set a weight loss goal, though, you could set that deadline for March 31.

After you’re done writing down your goals and picking deadlines for those goals, hand that slip of paper to someone important in your life who will hold you accountable. This can be your team leader, the broker in charge, your real estate coach, etc. They’ll know it’s important to you and you’re giving them permission to hold you accountable.

Remember, if you don’t have a plan, you have a plan to fail.

If you’d like to talk more about setting your 2019 goals or you have any questions for me about this topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak to you.
