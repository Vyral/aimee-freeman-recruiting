<h1>About the TEAM</h1>
<br>
We are a full service team of 15 agents, 2 support staff, a full time marketing specialist and an inside sales agent.

Our team is in the top 10 of all agents in our local area. In 2018 we closed 124 transactions & in 2019 Aimee & Co. intends to close over 300 homes!!! The agents that have joined our team did so because they wanted to play a significant part in that growth, and they believe in the vision. They each have HUGE personal and business GOALS, and we have made a commitment to helping each and every one of them achieve them when we became partners. Just ask any one of them!

We cultivate a productive and incredibly fun work culture with successful people that you'll enjoy working with. Our agents never feel alone because they have an entire team supporting them. We even have monthly team-only events! (Have you seen our FB page?)

We shine because we provide direction, support, systems, accountability, a training plan, and coaching to our team.

We allow our agents to focus on the 20% of the business that they do best: selling real estate! We have support staff team to do the other 80% that agents shouldn't be spending their time on if they want to achieve maximum success.

We stay in touch with our clients and hold several appreciation events for them throughout the year. The best compliment that you could receive is a referral, especially from a pleased past client. Therefore, one of our primary focuses is to establish lifelong clients and raving fans by continuing to show them what they mean to us, long after the sale.

We offer LEADS! Our team has more leads than we can honestly handle. We currently have over 11,000 people in our database, and we add around 600 new leads to it monthly. Not only do we have the leads, we teach our agents how to convert them.

We have a BIG vision! This also allows us to provide additional growth opportunities to our team as a result!
